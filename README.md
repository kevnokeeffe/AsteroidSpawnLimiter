# Asteroid Spawn Limiter

Asteroid Spawn Limiter is a simple mod for [Kerbal Space Program (KSP)](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com) that prevents the game from spawning excessive asteroids. It ensures a cleaner solar system and helps reduce performance impact by capping the number of untracked asteroids generated over time.
